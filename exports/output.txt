Pan European Analysis: Odds Ratios
	Odds Ratio (Inside vs. Buffer): 0.474
	Odds Ratio (Buffer vs. Inside): 2.111
Interpretation: The odds of a protected forest being disturbed are 0.474. Values less than one indicate a lowered probability.
	A protected forest is 32.1 percent less likely to be disturbed compared to an unprotected forest.
Interpretation: The odds of an uprotected forest being disturbed are 2.111. Values less than one indicate a lowered probability.
	An unprotected forest is 67.9 percent more likely to be disturbed compared to a protected forest.
